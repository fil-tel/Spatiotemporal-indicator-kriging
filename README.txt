In this repository I try to perform a spatiotempral indicator kriging. To do so, I started from the tutorial for an ordinary indicator kriging found here: https://zia207.github.io/geospatial-r-github.io/indicator-kriging.html

Briefly, I slightly modify the original dataset found in the tutortial, adding a temporal component. Subsequently, I implemented a spatiotemporal version of it following the scripts and tutorial found here:
https://github.com/FerRacimo/STAdmix/tree/master
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/08/spatio-temporal-kriging-in-r/

The reason why I did this is to become more familiar with ordinary and spatiotemporal kriging interpolation, that I might use for my master thesis. I decided to go for a spatiotemporal indicator version of it because I could not find any tutorial online designed for it.
